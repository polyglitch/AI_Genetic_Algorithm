# AI_Genetic_Algorithm
A project I did for my Artificial Intelligence Class

# Goal  
The goal of this assignment is to solve the [Traveling Salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). Unfortunately the Traveling Saleman problem can easily become too large to brute force. We can deal with this issue by writing a genetic algorithm. It won't give a perfect answer, but it will give one that is good enough.
